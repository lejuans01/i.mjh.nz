    <sub-title>After watching their already relegated side lose to the Invincibles on the last day of the 2003/4 Premier League season, some Leicester City fans stayed behind to watch Arsenal lift the trophy at Highbury. Those fans endured ten years in the wilderness, only for Leicester to return to the big time and embark on a rollercoaster couple of years. In that time they completed the great escape after being dead and buried at the foot of the table and then followed that up with the most unthinkable of Premier League triumphs. This is their story, one of sports greatest triumphs, told by those who wrote it.</sub-title>
